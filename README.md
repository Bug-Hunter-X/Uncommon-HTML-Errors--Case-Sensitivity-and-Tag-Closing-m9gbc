# Uncommon HTML Errors

This repository demonstrates two uncommon but easily missed errors in HTML:

1. **Case sensitivity in attribute names:** HTML is not case-sensitive, but it's good practice to use lowercase for attribute names.  Incorrect casing can lead to unexpected behavior or validation errors.
2. **Missing closing tags:** While many browsers can handle missing closing tags, it's crucial for code maintainability, validation, and proper rendering to ensure all opening tags have corresponding closing tags.

The `bug.html` file shows examples of these errors. The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected code.

This is useful to highlight issues that can sometimes be overlooked, even by experienced developers.
